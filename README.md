# Noiseless-communication-channel-simulation
In this project a noiseless channel was simulated using MATLAB, inputing any signal that passes through the whole PCM step (sampling, quantizing, encoding) alongside huffman source coding, before extracting the same signal at the receiver, measuring how good was the estimated signal at the receiver.
